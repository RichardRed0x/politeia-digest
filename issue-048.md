## New proposals

**[Decred Economic Education and Outreach](https://proposals.decred.org/record/c1f5b5c)**

This proposal requests $12,000 for around 6 months of work producing research papers, social media posts, memes and meetups. It is a revised version of a previous [proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/9e1d644) which had the same kind of content but as part of a book - this proposal was narrowly rejected with 57% Yes votes. The proposed outreach would focus on DCR as a sound money asset and Decred as a leading DAO. Primary deliverables would be 5-6 articles, secondary deliverables would be memes and social media outreach to support the primary deliverables, plus through @DecredCanada to promote a couple of meetups in the Toronto area. The proposed spending breakdown is $10,000 on research papers and $2,000 on memes and meetups.

Almost all of the comments are very positive and supportive of the proposal. The only negative comments come from @decredinator, but this one harks back to previous failed proposals about "Bitcoin Evolution" and tax documentaries - and even this one is considering a yes vote, "better than nothing I suppose".

## Rejected proposals

**[GoDCR (2021 - 2022)](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8)**

Published Sep 22 by raedah | edited Oct 7 | 31 comments (+8)

Final voting figures: 14,741 Yes votes, 15,234 No votes (49.2% Yes) - voter participation of 73%.

*Recap: This proposal requests a budget of $200,000 for one year of continued development of GoDCR, covering May 2021 to April 2022. This represents a significant increase in monthly cost ($7,500/month to $16,600/month) and duration from the initial [proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/e5c8051). The sponsorship of Gio UI is set to continue at a rate of $1,000/month, this is reported to have expedited bug fixes and supported the upstream project that GoDCR relies on. Progress on GoDCR has resulted in a preview testnet [release](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr/releases) which can be tested.*
