## New proposals

**[Decred Journal and Politeia Digest 2022](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4fdef29)**

Published 21 May by exitus | 6 comments

The Decred Journal team are back with a new proposal. After the old proposal ended at the end of 2021 the Decred Journal and Politeia Digest have been unfunded for five months, and inactive for most of that time. @exitus has bee instrumental in the return of the Decred Journal for an (unfunded) April issue, and now this proposal. The proposal requests funding of $33,000, which would cover 9 months of the Journal at max $3,000/month, and also 9 months of Politeia Digest at max $550/month - there is an additional $1,000 set aside to pay the contributors to the April 2022 Journal issue.

The comments on the proposal are all happy to see the return of the Journal.

**[Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 5](https://proposals.decred.org/record/da2f32d)**

Published 22 May by jholdstock | 5 comments

This proposal requests a maximum budget of $105,000 to fund 18 more months of the Bug Bounty program (formerly administered by @degeri). The budget is split into operating costs ($5,000) and reward payments ($100,000). Since the program started in Jany 2019 over 200 bug reports have been processed and 21 security vulnerabilities have been fixed as a result. A total of $10,154 has been paid to reporters since the program started, and operating costs for the previous year were $2,087.50.

@degeri left a comment to say they need to focus on IRL matters after the current proposal ends and therefore wish to pass responsibility on to @jholdstock. All of the comments are supportive of the proposal.
