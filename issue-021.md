## New proposals

**[Tantra Labs - Market Making Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/82ce113827140caaaf8b5779ab30402d3ed39f1911fdd2e8fa64cf0dc9e09ecb)**

This proposal from Tantra Labs offers to provide market making services for DCR pairs without charging for that service (Tantra would still bill for reimbursement of trading fees and the cost of borrowing inventory).

With 89 comments, this was the most actively discussed proposal on Politeia so far (previously this was the DEX RFP proposal with 84 comments).

The top [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/29) from @maxbronstein gives an account of the process of bringing the market maker proposals to Politeia, and argues in favor of approving one of these proposals. These arguments focus on the issue of low liquidity as a barrier to institutional investment and as a weakness for a Store of Value. Most of the other top comments are positive on moving forward with the RFP process but not necessarily persuaded by any of the available offers. @solar's [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/16) on this proposal are notably more negative about the need for market makers paid for by the Treasury than the others which have scored well. There are other comments with high scores which suggest to treat this as an experiment and start with a relatively small provision and cost. @jz responded to many questions on the RFP proposal ([not](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/58) [least](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/60) [from](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/61) [bee](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/59)) and in the #proposals channel, providing an education in market making following the Socratic method.

@bee showed up with some late [questions](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1/comments/14), and got some good answers from @chappjc shortly before voting ended.

## Market Makers Part 2: The Market-Makening

Altonomy dropped out of the running, editing the title of their [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60) to "Proposal Withdraw" and editing the text to say "Sorry, due to our technical capacity, we decided to withdraw this proposal." This sparked some discussion about whether the titles of live proposals should be editable, with the general consensus being that once the proposal goes live the owner should not be able to edit the title.

The proposals from Grapefruit and i2 were edited on Aug 26/27 to amend and clarify the terms of their offers - both of these proposals were authorized to start voting on Aug 27.

**[Grapefruit Trading Market Making proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b)**

Published Aug 7 by grapefruittrading, last updated Aug 26 - 39 comments ()

Grapefruit opted to go with the less expensive and looser of their 2 offers, [stating](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15668424562388499ecNYR:matrix.org) in #proposals that their reason for going forward with this option rather than the more expensive one was that they thought the community is looking for a more affordable option, and that it was also their preferred option.

The Grapefruit offer is $30k each side on 4 pairs at equivalent of 2% spread (flexible, could be up to 4% away from the price on either the buy or sell side). The monthly fee would be $28,000, trading fees would be covered by Grapefruit, and interest on the loaned inventory would cost around $2,900 per month, for a total maximum monthly cost of $30,900.

**[i2 Trading: DCR Market Making](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9)**

Published Aug 7 by i2trading, last updated Aug 27 - 55 comments ()

i2 amended their offer to reduce the monthly fee from $40,000 to $35,000 and reducing the cap on trading fees charged from $20k to $10k - while loosening the spread of the closest $10k from 1% to 1.5% and loosening the average market spread from 0.3% to 0.5% on BTC pairs and 0.75% on USD pairs. i2 also edited the proposal to say that they will provide read-only keys to a Decred representative for 2 hours per week, so that this designated community member can verify i2's market activity.

The final version of the proposal includes a line detailing the max total monthly costs: 45k USD, .213 BTC, 150 DCR, and 1600 USDT (All invoicing will be converted into USD and paid in DCR). This works out around $53,200/month maximum cost.

The top [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/31) on the i2 proposal is from @muststopmurad, endorsing i2's reliability as a cryptocurrency dealer and support of the Decred ecosystem.

### Community produced market maker resources

In addition to the in depth answers on Politeia, members of the Decred community have produced various resources which aim to inform the stakeholder community and facilitate the learning required to reach a collectively intelligent decision.

* @richardred has been maintaining this table and some notes about the differences between the offers (now in the [decredcommunity/proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/market-makers/comparison.md) repository). At current prices, these proposals would consume between 5-16% of Treasury inflow.
* @bee has written up a comprehensive [overview](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/market-makers/arguments.md) of the discussion in relation to specific questions and arguments, and also a detailed [dissection](https://github.com/xaur/writings/blob/master/20190822-dissection-market-makers-for-decred.md) of the subject, introducing relevant terms and presenting an overview of the key considerations.
* @exitus has produced a [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKSMA-eanoY) of the proposals.
* @richardred has collected data on the order books of 16 different pairs across 5 exchanges, and [written up some initial analysis (with graphs)](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/exchange-data) that compares DCR liquidity to other assets, in an effort to understand the current situation and how much difference $30-50k of additional liquidity would make to the order books. Summary is that DCR order books are relatively thin, especially on the sell side. The proposed additional liquidity would double or more the depth of orderbooks within 5% spread for most DCR pairs. This would still leave DCR with thinner order books than the other assets considered, even when taking the larger market capitalization of those assets into account.
