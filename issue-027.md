This proposal requests a maximum budget of $2,400/month (billed at $30/hr) for video content production. @exitus has been a member of the Decred community for some time and for the last few months has been producing videos about Decred on his Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvkBCFN0AMf3jXf8I7doaQ?view_as=subscriber). @Exitus plans to produce bi-weekly news updates and also videos introducing various aspects of the project - as well as some edits of existing videos that feature other contributors. He expects to produce 4-6 videos per month in 14-20 hours, each video will be of maximum length 10 minutes.

Comments on the proposal are very positive about Exitus' prior work, and many make the point that having this kind of video content about Decred is desirable.

This proposal requests a budget of $17,500 to continue @checkmate's research on fundamental metrics. The proposal gives an overview of the Phase 1 deliverables and sets out two components of Phase 2. The main component of Phase 2 ($15,000) is a continuation of the core research work, data driven analysis and armchair philosophy - a minimum of 4 but target of 5-6 papers of similar quality to Phase 1. The second component of the proposal is a $2,500 budget to specify new charts to be added to the dcrdata offering, working with @permabullnino. This has already been discussed with the dcrdata developers, who are supportive of the idea. Funding for the development work would not be covered by this proposal. @Checkmate has indicated that he expects the budget for this proposal to last for ~8 months.

Most of the comments on the proposal are positive, but there are also some highly critical comments, although these tend to have lower scores. There are also more down-votes than usual in the comments for this proposal.

This proposal requests $75,000 for marketing and events in Europe, to cover the remainder of 2020. There is $50,000 budgeted for one large event (like Web Summit, where the project has had a presence in previous years) and several smaller events. $25,000 is budgeted for ambassador hours, accommodation and transportation. The proposal goes beyond events to cover marketing, user support, creation of English content and local translations and community outreach. The proposal is supported by a group of independent contractors: @Haon, @jholdstock, @kozel, @jazzah, @mm and @karamble.

Early comments on the proposal ask about the $50k event budget and how much of that would be spent on Web Summit.

This proposal requests a budget of $2000/month, to be paid at a rate of $25/hour, for 2 months of work producing videos about Decred in Russian. @ivandecredfan lists a selection of video subjects and aims to make 5+ videos per month. His [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjXbEDeyhhj2bH2t_eGKGA) is new but he has added two sample videos. At the time when the proposal was created the channel had only one video lasting one minute, and a [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/92e3f2176b332c1aea5887acd2324c2cd730ec450e563df52ddae9d5927d5d36/comments/1) from @praxis calls this lack of demonstrated quality work out as the major differentiator to @exitus' proposal. The second 10 minute video has been added since then.

This proposal appears to be written in a stream of consciousness style and rambles quickly from subject to subject, most of which seem quite unrelated to the main thrust of the proposal, which is to produce 3 to 6 writings during the next 7 months. The proposal requests a total of $18,000, $3k in arrears for first publication and fundamental research (not clear what this refers to), $12k for 7 months of research, and $3k for flights from Mexico to Europe, to attend festivals.

Comments criticize the rambling nature of the proposal and its lack of coherent detail about what is being proposed.

## Market Maker update

[Analysis](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/exchange-data/blob/master/mm-tracking2/market-making-update2.md) of the full month of November's trading on markets where i2 are active indicated that there were likely some issues with the terms of the proposal being met. This analysis was shared with i2 Trading and Decred representatives in mid-December, and it was determined that it would be necessary to audit the order open/close history from i2's exchange accounts. The analysis of public order book data was not publicised as efforts were being made to conduct a more rigorous analysis which would produce more definitive results.

Company 0 have written code to audit the order logs and check, using i2's own data, whether the conditions described in the proposal were being met throughout the month of November. The detailed results of these audits will not be published as the data is considered sensitive by i2 Trading. Efforts are being made to set up API accounts that will allow Company 0 to retrieve the i2 trading data directly from the exchanges for future audits, increasing confidence in the data further.

One of the issues observed in the open data related to USD and USDT pairs, where it transpired that i2 were basing their targets on prices denominated in BTC (1/3/5 BTC) rather than USD ($10k/$30k/$50k). After the proposal was approved, a decrease in BTC's USD price meant that 5 BTC was no longer equivalent to $50k, and so the amount in open orders on USD markets was lower. This resulted in very poor performance against the metrics defined in the analysis of the open order book data, as this was based on USD denominated targets. i2 have committed to switching over to the USD denominated targets in the near future.

i2 will be invoicing for less than the full fee for November. Due to onboarding issues with OKCoin, it was agreed with Decred representatives that i2 would only operate on 5 pairs, with the invoiced fee amount adjusted down accordingly.

The auditing software produced by Company 0 considers the state of i2's open orders every minute and assesses whether the target liquidity was there at each of the layers. The BBO spread is also assessed to see if it is within the required range (0.5% for BTC pairs, 0.75% for USD). These measures are averaged for the month to give a generalized "uptime" measure, and if this percentage is lower than the target of 90% uptime i2's billable amount will be adjusted downwards by a proportionate amount. Both i2 Trading and Company 0 are happy that this represents a fair way to gauge their performance in the market maker role.

i2's performance according to this measure is significantly better than @richard-red's analysis of the public order book data indicated. One of the issues identified with the public data was that it was missing i2's orders when they were being momentarily cancelled and moved - this is not an issue when using their order open/close data. Another issue with the public data analysis was that it used the mid-point between Best Buy and Offer (BBO) to set the requirements, whereas the terms of the proposal are specified in relation to the BBO points themselves (which can have a spread of 0.5-0.75%). This meant that i2's orders were sometimes outside the range the analysis was using to count hits and misses, whereas they were actually within the accepted range as defined in the proposal.
