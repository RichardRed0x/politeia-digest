## New proposals

**[DCRDEX integration on Umbrel](https://proposals.decred.org/record/8d83046)**

Published Jan 9 by peter_zen, last edited Jan 18 | 13 comments

This proposal requests $1,960 to integrate DCRDEX into the Umbrel app store. Umbrel is an Operating System for running a personal server in one's home using x86 or Raspberry Pi, it has some popularity with crypto users because of the fit between self-custody and self-hosting. peter_zen is an established DCRDEX contributor who is proposing to complete the work to configure DCRDEX for Umbrel and submit it to the app store, where it would be easily installable by any Umbrel user. The proposal originally requested $1,000 but was edited to add additional work to investigate some of the issues raised and monitoring/support, bringing the budget to $1,960.

All of the comments on the proposal are supportive, including from several Decred developers.

This proposal requests a budget of $45,600 to continue and expand the work of the Decred Video team (Decred Society, Exitus, Karamble, Tivra). For the previous proposal the total billed was $27,026, this proposal increases the monthly limit from $3,200 to $3,800. Major developments this year were the launch of "State of the market" which is filling the void left by Decred in Depth, and Tivra's recent test runs with Twitter spaces.

All of the comments on the proposal are supportive.

This proposal requests a budget of $13,000 to continue with the established program and team led by arij. The previous proposal spent $3,140 (~30% of budget), and members attended 5 events, with a further 2 after the proposal ended ($450 is being requested to cover these). The proposal includes a table of 6 planned events and associated expenses, as well as a budget of $2,100 for the production of 3 videos.

**[Sponsorship in Motorsports](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2b19c56)**

Published Jan 18 by laurent | 3 comments

This proposal requests a budget of $26,033 for sponsorship of a professional race car driver as they compete in the 2023 BGDC races driving a Honda Civic Type R. The proposal would have Decred as the sole sponsor, with the car being painted in Decred colours and with the Decred logo. The Decred-liveried Honda Civic would feature in 5 races around Europe, and the sponsorship money would cover all associated costs aside from car depreciation and repairs following the event. 40% of the budget is being requested as an up-front payment, with the remainder to be paid out in four 15% instalments over the course of the year.

The initial comments are asking for evidence that this is a real offer by a legitimate racing driver.

**[Rick Red Revival: Research and assorted other tasks](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f12258b)**

Published Jan 18 by richard-red | 4 comments

This proposal requests a budget of $32,500 for one year of work covering a variety of domains and tasks. It includes a research component which follows on from the "open source research" series, and a number of other components, along with approximate and maximum spending limits per component. The research component has an estimated spend of $10,000 and would include Politeia data collection and analysis as well as research on other communities' governance. Politeia moderation and running the @pi_crumbs twitter account has an estimate of $1800. $5,000 is earmarked for quality assurance type testing of Decred software and writing issues, tutorials and reviews. There are also some more novel categories with budgets, with an estimated $4,000 to be spent on producing more [Clay Stakey](https://www.youtube.com/@claystakey5157) stop-motion animations,  $1,000 for novelty graphics in the @[BisonContent](https://twitter.com/BisonContent) style, as well as a $2,000 miscellaneous heading to cover general helping out not covered elsewhere. Of the total budget, $2,500 is requested as payment in arrears for Politeia moderation ($1,000) and the already produced Clay Stakey content ($1,500).

The initial two comments raise questions about the unusual mix of activities falling under a single proposal, although one is supportive of the proposal anyway.

*Recap: This proposal requested $1,955 for work which has been done on reviving the [@dcrtimestampbot](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot) Twitter bot which archives tweets where it is mentioned in IPFS and timestamps them in the Decred blockchain. The bot was last active in [January 2022](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot/status/1480249464988307457). The proposal is from whoever is running the [@StakeShuffle_](https://twitter.com/StakeShuffle_) Twitter bot (which has two [approved](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2895755) [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/record/1a290d8) now), they were contacted by @tiagoalvesdulce to help addressing some issues with the bot and re-wrote the original [JavaScript code](https://github.com/tiagoalvesdulce/dcrtimestamptweet) in Python. New version of the bot can be tested by interacting with the [test account](https://twitter.com/test2332_te) on Twitter, and a web [front-end](https://dcr-timestampbot.com/) was also added where users can look up their timestamped tweets. New Python code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/JC60522/dcr_timestampbot) under a MIT license.*
