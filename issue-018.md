The proposal provides a breakdown of operating spending from the first 6 months, which totaled $2,450 and included $1,500 bring up costs for the [website](https://bounty.decred.org). Bounty payments totaled $3,729 for 8 reported vulnerabilities out of a total of 58 submissions. The proposal requests an extension of 1 year for the Bounty program, during which time operating costs would be capped at $6,500 and Bounty payouts would be capped at $100,000. The scope of the Bounty program's operating costs would be extended to include writeups and work defining policies/rules and scope.

**[Supplemental Proposal For Decred Tutorials By Denni Lovejoy](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd)**

This proposal is a follow-up to the [tutorial videos proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f) approved in March. @dennilovejoy submitted an invoice for $7,500 in June, which is $6,750 over the budget of $750 approved in the original proposal. @jy-p explains in this [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd/comments/2) that, after consulting with other contributors, it was decided that @dennilovejoy should submit another proposal to cover the additional budget, and that this would be standard policy going forward. @dennilovejoy has framed this proposal as having two components, $2,850 for the overrun costs of the 3 planned videos and $3,900 for an additional 3 videos explaining how to verify Decred software binaries on Windows, Linux and Max. 

Comments so far are not supportive of the proposal, citing the bad precedent it would set for cost overruns on future proposals. Some comments are also critical of the quality of the videos produced, while others express empathy for @dennilovejoy's situation. @s_ben wrote a thoughtful [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd/comments/7) explaining how the proposal was worked on by @dennilovejoy with feedback from the #writers room, and speculating on how this could have resulted in mixed signals about whether extra work would be paid for.

### Abandoned proposals

Published Jun 12 by cryptoeconomy, last updated Jun 13 - 9 comments (+9)

This proposal requested $33,600 to promote Decred in a number of ways, including banner advertisements , press releases and a Decred giveaway on [crypto-economy.net](https://www.crypto-economy.net), several weekly mentions in Youtube videos and a newsletter. Comments pointed out that some aspects are already being well covered within the project and the others are not desirable. The proposal title originally misspelled Decred as "Decreed"&mdash;this was corrected after it was pointed out in a comment. The proposal owner then commented to say that they wished to withdraw the proposal without putting it to a vote, in response to the comments received. The proposal was marked as abandoned on June 15, making it the fastest proposal cycle in Politeia's short history.

As noted in the last issue of Politeia Digest, @betterfuture decided to withdraw this proposal and submit it as two separate proposals. @betterfuture submitted these two proposals, and also has two other proposals in the review queue. Discussions are ongoing about which of these should be published and which withdrawn, with @betterfuture also looking at other ways to bring in external teams that can add value to the project.

### Other news

The EXMO exchange added Decred pairs (DCR/BTC, DCR/RUB, DCR/UAH) on 18 June, fulfilling the main deliverables of their approved [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7). Prior to this, a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bx00fu/so_about_the_exmo_exchange/) on reddit had observed that EXMO were behind schedule, followed a few days later by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1138020825137930240) from EXMO thanking the Decred community for its patience.

Decred’s part of the Trust Wallet integration is nearing completion. Approved by voters in march, this [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571) split work between the Trust Wallet team, which was tasked with the core wallet integration, and Decred, which was tasked with integrating with and hosting the Blockbook server Trust Wallet uses to host transaction data. Core wallet integration has been completed by Trust Wallet, and Decred’s Blockbook integration is [nearing completion](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/pull/216)), with one final issue remaining regarding how to represent Decred’s unique PoS voting mechanism in Blockbook data.
