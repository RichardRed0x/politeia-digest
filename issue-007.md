### Politeia Discussions

@degeri [shared](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154324102625321rrnzj:decred.org) another iteration of their [bug bounty proposal](https://github.com/degeri/Decred-Bug-Bounty-Proposal). Among the changes are: the methology was changed from CVSS v3.0 to OWASP Risk Rating, a list of contractors to do the work was added, the payouts are estimated to not cross $100k for 6 months.

The subject of what happens to proposals that don't meet the quorum requirement was discussed. @davecgh [kicked off](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154281169322280KaecY:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) the discussion by suggesting that should the Easyrabbit proposal fail to reach the quorum requirement another round of voting would be required - because in most contexts a quorum is required before a group can make binding decisions. Most people who commented are interpreting the meaning differently for Pi - failure to reach the quorum is one of two ways that proposals can fail (the other being <60% Yes votes).

@snr01 collected final versions of voting graphs in a [repository](https://github.com/snr01/PiVotingCharts).

@richardred shared the line graph below showing voting activity over time for each of the six proposals that have finished voting.

![Proposal ticket votes over time](img/issue006/proposal-ticket-votes-over-time.png)

The dashed line indicates an approximate quorum requirement (20% of the 49.960 target for the ticket pool).

The first four proposals to go up for a vote started voting at the same time and had fairly similar voting rates for the first 4-5 days. At this point the only contentious proposal was Ditto's and it continued to receive votes at a high rate until the end of the voting window. The easyrabbit proposal stands out here in that it had a much lower voter participation level than the others, and didn't reach the quorum requirement until near the end of the voting period.
