This is a proposal by Ian Freeman, one of the hosts of [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com/), for Decred to sponsor the show. The proposer asks for $22,750 for 13 weeks of sponsorship, for which Decred would get a live promotion, 30 second radio ad each day and some banners. The proposal owner and co-host ([@medge2](https://proposals.decred.org/user/fc9b8afd-c10b-42cc-82d4-b354da10f14e)) have been engaging in a thorough discussion with the community. Several participants have expressed support for FTL and the proposal, while others have expressed a desire to wait and see how this kind of sponsorship opportunity fits into Decred's overall communications plan.

The strongest critiques were about a lack of detail and lack of evidence that REUM can deliver. To their credit, the proposal owner responded to many criticisms in comments. @ryanzim [pointed out](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc/comments/38) that REUM appear to have removed a page about "REUM Brand Agency" from their website after it had been criticized.

A proposal by the [Bcash](https://bcash.eu/) company to integrate Decred in the ATMs they run themselves, and those they sell to customers (for 2 years). The proposal requested a starting budget of 25,000 EUR and a monthly budget of 1,650 EUR equivalent in DCR for maintenance. Several comments object to the maintenance fee, some express support for the concept of ATMs in general but are reticent about this particular proposal. @oregonisaac [checked out](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/22) a number of ATM providers with regard to how they handle integrations and any fees they charge.
