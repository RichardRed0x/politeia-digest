**[Grassroots Marketing - growing the Decred community (withDecred.org)](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2bf72e6)**

Published Sep 16 by m_ax | edited Sep 29 | {n} comments (+{})

This proposal from Pavel Svitek requests a budget of $6,485, which is broken down into $5,000 for DCR giveaway promotions and $297 per month for 5 months of maintenance and development of [withDecred.org](https://withDecred.org). Development of the site was led by @pavel and the content was written by @pablito, with contributions from @El Capitan, review and editing by @richard-red and @ammarooni plus some other contributors. The proposal estimates the bring-up cost of the site as $7,000-$8,000, but is not asking for back-pay and instead requests money to use in promoting the site. Much of the proposal describes the method of conducting the giveaways, which has already been trialled and further developed since the proposal was submitted. The final version of this has participants tweeting images obtained from withDecred.org that have a message about Decred and a QR code with the latest block hash, to limit fraudulent entries.

The website differs from decred.org in that it is designed around a funnel, and the server has 1st-party analytics software installed (no IP address or personal info gathered) to understand what people are reading and where they drop off.

The proposal was edited to include a link to an episode of the Staked [podcast](https://anchor.fm/staked-podcast/episodes/Interview-with-Pavel-Svitek-Co-founder-of-WithDecred-org-ek1749) which @pavel appeared on, and he recommends that people listen to it from the 20-25 minute point to get a more complete description of his approach to marketing Decred.
