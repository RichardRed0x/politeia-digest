**[Grassroots Marketing - growing the Decred community (withDecred.org)](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2bf72e6)**

Published Sep 16 by m_ax | edited Sep 29 | {n} comments (+{})

This proposal from Pavel Svitek requests a budget of $6,485, which is broken down into $5,000 for DCR giveaway promotions and $297 per month for 5 months of maintenance and development of [withDecred.org](https://withDecred.org). Development of the site was led by @pavel and the content was written by @pablito, with contributions from @El Capitan, review and editing by @richard-red and @ammarooni plus some other contributors. The proposal estimates the bring-up cost of the site as $7,000-$8,000, but is not asking for back-pay and instead requests money to use in promoting the site. Much of the proposal describes the method of conducting the giveaways, which has already been trialled and further developed since the proposal was submitted. The final version of this has participants tweeting images obtained from withDecred.org that have a message about Decred and a QR code with the latest block hash, to limit fraudulent entries.

The website differs from decred.org in that it is designed around a funnel, and the server has 1st-party analytics software installed (no IP address or personal info gathered) to understand what people are reading and where they drop off.

The proposal was edited to include a link to an episode of the Staked [podcast](https://anchor.fm/staked-podcast/episodes/Interview-with-Pavel-Svitek-Co-founder-of-WithDecred-org-ek1749) which @pavel appeared on, and he recommends that people listen to it from the 20-25 minute point to get a more complete description of his approach to marketing Decred.

**[Invoice PR/HR/Marketing for Decred 2016/2017/2018](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f279ed5)**

This proposal requests $12,000 for historical work completed by @alexsolo in 2016/17/18, to cover 380 hours of work. The activities covered by this include running a Facebook page and growing community on Slack and twitter, organizing translations, and some PR wins, including someone who got a Decred tattoo while @alexsolo was posting on Facebook. The proposal explains the long delay before making a proposal for this work as being due to a misunderstanding, where they had provided their details and expected to be paid but did not receive payment.

Many comments on the proposal describe negative interactions with @alexsolo as they posted negative comments about Decred across a range of platforms in 2018/19, after their relationship with the project soured. @jy-p provided an [account](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f279ed5695c9aff93e935a4665b67cff2f1032a2baffc6f3474cd0c97f9dde53/comments/48) of how this occurred. This began when a contractor invited @alexsolo to the contractors chat and he was invited to submit itemized invoices for any work he wished to be paid for, but no invoices were submitted and after some months of @alexsolo failing to make meaningful contributions he was removed from that channel. Other comments criticize the substance of the claimed contributions and whether their value outweighs the negative value of subsequent activities.
