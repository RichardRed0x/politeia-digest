[Decred Contractor Clearance Process](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4) - submitted October 19th by jy-p

This proposal is about formalizing Decred's process for approving new contributors to be paid for their work. A Decred Contractor Clearance (DCC) would be required for every person whose work is being charged to the Treasury. The process of granting and revoking DCCs requires the agreement of at least 3 established contributors in the relevant subdomain. Methods of escalating issues to an all-contractor vote, and ultimately a stakeholder vote, were also described.
