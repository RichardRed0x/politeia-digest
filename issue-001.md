This proposal aims to establish an open source research program for the Decred project. An initial budget of $10k was requested, with the idea being to submit another proposal for further funding within a few months if the initial results look good. The proposal was edited on October 22nd in response to requests for more detail about the selection of research subjects.

This proposal is about changing some of the terms used in relation to Decred's Proof of Stake system. The proposal also asks whether Politeia approval should be required for such decisions going forward. The proposal also lists various community resources (sites and software) that will have to be updated in the event that the proposal passes.



**[Decred Contractor Clearance Process](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4) - submitted October 19th by jy-p**

This proposal is about formalizing Decred's process for approving new contributors to be paid for their work. A Decred Contractor Clearance (DCC) would be required for every person whose work is being charged to the Treasury. The process of granting and revoking DCCs requires the agreement of at least 3 established contributors in the relevant subdomain. Mechanisms for escalating issues to an all-contractor vote, and ultimately a stakeholder vote, were also described.

### Two Communications Proposals

As [explained by dustorf](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154023798936000RPDxl:decred.org) in the new [Proposals](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org) channel, Wachsman and Ditto were invited to pitch proposals to the Decred community on Politeia - following a short-listing process and some initial discussions.

**[Wachsman Communications Proposal for Decred](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092) - submitted October 19th by tomcurranlevett**

Proposal for a range of professional communications support services, $20k/month for 6 months.

**[Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50) - submitted October 22nd by blainr**

Proposal for a range of professional communications support services, $20k/month + $10k/month DCR equivalent for 6 months - with a 90-day out clause.



The range of services on offer by the two firms seem broadly similar, so I'm not going to describe them here.

It has been great to see thorough critiques of the proposals by community members, and representatives of both firms are now getting stuck in with thoughtful answers to the community's questions and concerns.    It should be interesting to see how these discussions develop and which of these firm's proposals the Decred stakeholders approve, if either!
