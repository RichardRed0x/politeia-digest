This proposal presents a new look and messaging for decred.org, [showcased](https://dream.jholdstock.uk/) on a staging server by @jholdstock.

Some background: In September 2020 an [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) was submitted by @richard-red and approved with 85% Yes votes - but none of the four candidate proposals which were submitted managed to reach the 60% approval threshold. The closest proposal to the threshold was [D.R.E.A.M.](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4532397) by @jz with 48% approval and turnout of 11,686 votes (comfortably over the 20% quorum threshold).

Following the [failure of any of the messaging RFP candidates to pass](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) in September 2020, @jy-p was not satisfied with how the RFP process went and, rather than repeat a similar process to revise the messaging now, has worked with @jz, @jholdstock and @saender to prepare a refreshed and simplified website for decred.org.

> Design work from saender cost 2,010 USD, site work from jholdstock cost 2,650 USD, messaging work from jz was done free of charge, and management from jy-p was also done free of charge.

Following discussion in the comments a translation budget of $3,000 was added, and some tweaks were made to the prototype site in response to comments (like adding more links to dcrdata). Comments are all supportive of the proposal and make suggestions for changing the site in various ways.

Published 25 June by phoenixgreen | 12 comments

Final voting figures: 87% Yes votes, 28% turnout of eligible tickets.

*Recap: This proposal requested a budget of $34,000 for one year of content production and aggregation on [DecredMagazine.com](https://www.decredmagazine.com/). @phoenixgreen has collected content from a variety of Decred contributors and republished this with their permission on decredmagazine.com - along with a steady stream of new content produced for the magazine. @phoenixgreen takes the role of editor while @Applesaucesome and @OfficialCryptos are named as Official Contributors, social media users will recognise these long term and active community members who have not usually been paid for their efforts historically. The proposal sets out an expansion plan targeting the recruitment of more Official Contributors with various backgrounds. A content production schedule is provided which targets 2-4 items per week for one year covering Decred news, markets, development and broader topics. The proposal also sets out a plan for promoting each item of content across various channels. Contributors would be paid at a rate of $30/hr, and caps have been placed on the editor role (10 hr/week), as well as on a per article basis (4 hours for medium length piece, 8 hours for long).*

## Rejected Proposals

**[GoDCR: Golang Desktop and Mobile Wallets (2022-2023)](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0ef42e5)**

Published 2 June by raedah | edited 15 June | 59 comments

Final voting figures: 20% Yes votes, 57% turnout of eligible tickets.

*Recap: This proposal requested $250,000 to fund continued development of GoDCR for 12 months, and it would also cover maintenance of existing mobile wallet apps until GoDCR is ready to take their place. GoDCR is a wallet written in Golang which aims to deliver a more lightweight user experience than Decrediton, it uses Gio for the user interface and has been supporting Gio with $1,000/month sponsorship. The amount requested by this proposal was originally $300,000 but this was edited down, and the proposal notes that May and June 2022 work is being paid out of pocket by @raedah - a continuation of the self-funding arrangement for this work since the [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/f7d9fc8) was rejected with 49% support in Oct 2021. The major development features for this year are mobile GoDCR (20 weeks), DCRDEX integration (10 weeks), UI improvements (9 weeks) and coin control UTXO selection (6 weeks).*

Following the rejection of this proposal @raedah [announced](https://matrix.to/#/!gruHpujXftcsHcghjx:planetdecred.org/$tSIfmIcwrrtslpOU04O5m8y8cJzumZvds5ipv9coB30?via=planetdecred.org&via=decred.org&via=matrix.org) in the #planetdecred Matrix room that the room is closing and "Work on godcr is ending and we will be focusing on other non-decred work that is fundable and can get the team to break even on costs."

**[Decred Brazil - Marketing, Communication and Content Production 2022/2](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7f1d013)**

Published 16 June by victorguedes | 18 comments

Final voting figures: 19% Yes votes, 57% turnout of eligible tickets.

*Recap: This proposal requested a budget of $22,000 for social media content production, communications and events in Brazil, to cover 6 months of work over the second half of 2022. The leaders of this proposal are different to the previous Decred Brazil proposals, and acknowledge that the previous [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f98), led by @emiliomann, did not deliver the expected results. @victorguedes, a long-term Decred developer, has been granted control of many accounts related to Decred Brazil, and is joined in the proposal by @jpsantanna, @edsondecre and @eric\_vieira - together they have already begun to resurrect the accounts and Decred Brazil's social media presence. Contributors to the project would be paid at one of 3 levels ($10/20/30 per hour), with an average rate of $17/hr being used to set a labor budget of $18,900 based on 15 hours per week, with additional funding for ads ($1,200) and event expenses ($1,500). The proposal sets targets for the number of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok videos, along with a target number of events.*
