### New proposals

**[RFP: Decred Decentralized Exchange Infrastructure](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) - submitted Feb 3 by jy-p, published Feb 4 - 18 comments**

This proposal seeks to establish stakeholder support for building Decentralized Exchange Infrastructure. If it is approved this will trigger a Request for Proposals (RFP) process whereby interested developers are invited to put forward proposals for how they would go about the task and how much they would charge.  The proposal sets a limit for the requested budget to between USD 100,000 and 1,000,000. The proposal "describes new type of cryptocurrency-only decentralized exchange based on open source software that will allow cross-chain trading to occur directly between users, with minimal fees and a simple client-server architecture." 

Many of the comments on the proposal express appreciation for the exchange's design and aims,  while observing that it would be a significant expenditure and expressing doubts about whether it is something that Decred should bear the full cost of at a time when prices are low across the board. Another common question is whether the DEX will be able to attract liquidity, to which jy-p responded that a number of DCR holders have expressed interest in making the market for DCR/BTC on this kind of exchange. Market making is a service which many projects pay for to improve their liquidity, and the DEX is viewed as an alternative solution that also provides valuable infrastructure that's needed by the broader cryptocurrency space. jy-p also responded to many of the comments, answering questions on technical aspects and explaining how the specification is designed to nullify problematic behavior on the part of traders.

The Baeond proposal was edited 8 times in total in response to discussions with the community. On Jan 6 the proposal was edited to include an offer of airdropping starter packs of cards to Decred holders. While several commenters expressed interest in the game, there was almost universal agreement that it would not be appropriate for Decred to fund its development. nnnk056 [put it well](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14):

> The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).
>
> The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.
>
> At the moment, the primary question that anyone who want to make a proposal should ask beforehand IMO is: Who is the primary beneficiary of this proposal? " If the answer is not Decred or the Decred ecosystem, or the Decred Community, expect strong opposition from stakeholders..

### Other News

A new twitter account was started which will send simple tweets to notify when proposals are created/modified or start/finish voting - [@pi_crumbs](https://twitter.com/pi_crumbs). This account could be automated with a bot, but will initially be operated manually to determine whether there is demand for it. The intention is to add another notification channel for Politeia and stimulate discussion of the proposals on twitter.

Francio (Coffee wallet [proposer](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/45de9806c952c5ffc2fc6782fddbc74c852c26e3fb0e950144b92d75082c4731)) [appeared](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15467875879232uBQcG:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com&via=gwusbdhdu.org) in chat to say they did not mean to abandon their proposal. Once a proposal is abandoned this cannot be reversed, so Francio was advised that they would have to submit the proposal again if they want it to be considered.

A feature has been added to the proposal site which allows for viewing previous versions of a proposal through the interface.
