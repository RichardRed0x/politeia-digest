## New proposals

**[DCR-Timestamp_bot](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0848cc9)**

Published Oct 19 by coinshuffle_bot | 4 comments

This proposal requests $1,955 for work which has been done on reviving the [@dcrtimestampbot](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot) twitter bot which archives tweets where it is mentioned in IPFS and timestamps them in the Decred blockchain. The bot was last active in [January 2022](https://twitter.com/dcrtimestampbot/status/1480249464988307457). The proposal is from whoever is running the [@StakeShuffle_](https://twitter.com/StakeShuffle_) twitter bot (which has two [approved](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2895755) [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/record/1a290d8) now), they were contacted by @tiagoalvesdulce to help addressing some issues with the bot and re-wrote the original [JavaScript code](https://github.com/tiagoalvesdulce/dcrtimestamptweet) in Python. New version of the bot can be tested by interacting with the [test account](https://twitter.com/test2332_te) on Twitter, and a web [front-end](https://dcr-timestampbot.com/) was also added where users can look up their timestamped tweets. New Python code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/JC60522/dcr_timestampbot) under a MIT license. Most of the cost of the proposal is in 48 hours of work charged at 35 USD per hour.

@tiagoalvesdulce [commented](https://proposals.decred.org/record/0848cc9/comments/1) on the proposal to say it has their support and the cost is reasonable.

Final voting figures: 66% Yes votes, 59% turnout of eligible tickets.

This proposal requests $48,000 for another year of PR services, up to $4,000/month from $3,500/month previously, reflecting increases to rates and scope. The expanded scope relates to helping out with Decred Magazine. Lindsey maintains a [list](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/blob/data/data/monde-pr-media-coverage.csv) of all the press coverage which has been generated by the first 3 phases of the PR proposal.

**[D.R.E.A.M. 2: Dream Harder](https://proposals.decred.org/record/5ef57f7)**

Published 4 August by jy-p | edited 11 August | 28 comments

Final voting figures: 97% Yes votes, 59% turnout of eligible tickets.

*Recap: This proposal presents a new look and messaging for decred.org, [showcased](https://dream.jholdstock.uk/) on a staging server by @jholdstock.*

*Some background: In September 2020 an [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) was submitted by @richard-red and approved with 85% Yes votes - but none of the four candidate proposals which were submitted managed to reach the 60% approval threshold. The closest proposal to the threshold was [D.R.E.A.M.](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4532397) by @jz with 48% approval and turnout of 11,686 votes (comfortably over the 20% quorum threshold).*

*Following the [failure of any of the messaging RFP candidates to pass](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) in September 2020, @jy-p was not satisfied with how the RFP process went and, rather than repeat a similar process to revise the messaging now, has worked with @jz, @jholdstock and @saender to prepare a refreshed and simplified website for decred.org.*

## Updates

@lukebp posted an [update](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4475472/comments/7) on the Politeia 2022 Q1 proposal announcing that [the site](https://proposals.decred.org/) was updated to v1.4.0, with most of the work going into the importing of legacy Git backend proposals into Trillian, along with some new features like allowing edits to comments within 5 minutes of their posting.

As a consequence of the import, legacy Git proposals have different tokens in the new database, but redirects have been setup to keep old links work. Additionally, each legacy proposal has a notice directing to the old [Git repository](https://github.com/decred-proposals/mainnet) hosting all original data, including signatures and timestamps (which we not imported).
